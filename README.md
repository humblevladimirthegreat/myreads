# MyReads Project

This is my implementation of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Basic CSS and HTML was provided but all React code was written by me. The project is to have an application where users can search for books and add them to their the various shelves on their library.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

Udacity provided the backend server. The file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods for accessing the backend.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
